<h1>SimpleJGE</h1>
Kat R. | CS 439 - Game Engine Development

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    Both as a final project and as a personal challenge,
    this is a port of Mr. Andy Harris's <i><code>pygame</code></i> layer <a href="https://github.com/twopiharris/simpleGE" target="_blank"><i><b><code>simpleGE</code></b></i></a>
    from <code>python</code>/<i><code>pygame</code></i> to <code>Java</code>/<code>JavaFX</code>.
    The end goal is for the two to be as identical impossible in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Syntax</li>
    <li>Classes</li>
    <li>Class Attributes and Scope</li>
    <li>Functionality</li>
    <li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Given that pygame was made to be a game engine itself,
    I anticipate that the port to Swing will require a much different perspective.
    Swing is not built for games outright, but it is still good for making a low-level engine of sorts.
</p>
<p>
    The ultimate challenge will be to faithfully recreate some games made with simpleGE,
    such as <i>Always a Bigger Fish</i>, a game I wrote myself using simpleGE.
</p>

<h2>On <i><b><code>simpleGE</code></b></i></h2>
<p>
    I have compiled an analysis on simpleGE's source code itself, 
    including its classes, class attributes, and class methods, 
    as well as the pygame classes they extend and associate.
    For a birds-eye view, see the <a href="readme/simpleGE.mmd">Mermaid Chart for <i><b><code>simpleGE</code></b></i></a>.
    Alternatively, you can view this <a href="https://www.mermaidchart.com/d/f60c8348-60d4-41de-80ae-f88c111098e5" target="_blank">online version</a>
    that is more graphically compatible, but may not be <i>quite</i> so up-to-date.
